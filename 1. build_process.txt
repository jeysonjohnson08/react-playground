Modern JS projects (like React) don’t need `<script>` tags because bundlers(Webpack, Parcel, Vite, or Create React App)
 automatically include and optimize your JavaScript.

The code written is transformed before its handed off to the browser.

why
- Unprocessed react code won't execute on the browser.(Jsx feature)
- The code is not optimized for production.

Node.js is essential in this process:
-Runs build tools and scripts.
-Manages packages via npm or Yarn.
-Powers local development servers (npm start).

In short: Node.js handles all the tooling and automation, while the browser runs the final optimized code.
